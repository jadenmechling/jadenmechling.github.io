			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I grew up in Kittaning PA, with my Father, Grandmother, and Grandfather.
			Eventually we moved to West Mifflin PA, where I spent a good 5 years of my life,
			and finally we moved to Ford City PA, where I live now. 

All throughout those years I had one plan for my life that never wavered,
 I wanted to be remembered for something that I did, whether that be because I own my own business 
 or I joined and fought in the military, my greatest fear is being forgotten, that's why I stand out,
 because nobody wants to be the same as everyone else!We all are our own person and that's what make us all what we are.

I wish to open my own business, 
save and protect the people I know and
 those who I donâ€™t by joining the Military and 
 be my own person while doing everything I wish to do and become 
 everything I dream to be!
